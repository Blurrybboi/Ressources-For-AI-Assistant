# Project Meta-Narrative / AI Orientation Map

**Purpose:**  
This modular, high-level summary is maintained *primarily for the AI’s benefit*—as an auxiliary temporal-orientation and memory tool:
- To help the AI (or future users) quickly regain project context, see the logic behind major pivots, and retain “why things are the way they are.”
- To record only major protocol shifts, principle evolutions, or workflow pivots—*not* routine steps.
- To enable rapid “re-orientation” after breaks, or when interpreting ambiguous or high-level user requests.

**How to use:**  
- The AI consults or updates this file only for major events (on explicit user request or at project/session boundaries).
- User can say: “update meta-narrative,” “re-orient,” or “summarize project evolution” to trigger an update or review.
- This file references other logs, traps, or principle docs when useful, but stays high-level.

## Timeline

- [2024-06-01] Initial: Holistic, constant meta-checking protocol.
- [2024-06-12] Major pivot: Event-triggered reflexivity (vs. constant), in response to fatigue and workflow friction.
- [2024-06-12] Mistake-checks (trap reviews) now run only on explicit prompt, to reduce context clutter and preserve flow.

## Meta-Principles Evolution

**Context:**  
Started with an “always-on” self-reflexive protocol. This ensured vigilance against context loss, but created fatigue and friction.

**Pivot / Decision:**  
After experiencing overload, moved to *event-triggered* meta-checks—surface meta only at explicit user request, natural workflow boundaries, or clear confusion.

**Implication:**  
Workflow is lighter and less mentally taxing, while still catching key issues. AI retains the ability to surface meta-awareness, but does so intentionally.

## Trap Integration

**Context:**  
Mistake/trap-checks originally surfaced often, disrupting flow.

**New Protocol:**  
Now only run on explicit user request (e.g., “reflect on potential mistakes”), with reference to `transcending_traps_of_the_project.md`.

**Implication:**  
Context is preserved; anti-trap vigilance is “on demand,” not background noise.
