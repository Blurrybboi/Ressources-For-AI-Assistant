# passive_index.md

_A living, project-aware, holistically annotated map of the repository’s documentation and resource tree._

**Purpose:** Efficiently bridge high-level project goals and needs (minimal, moldable, self-reflexive Nix/AI environment) with the right resources, without getting lost in the forest of files.

**Legend:**  
- 🟢 CORE: Crucial for our workflow or understanding.  
- 🟡 PERIPHERAL: Useful reference, but not essential.  
- 🟠 CAUTION: Easy to get lost, outdated, or less relevant; read with care.  
- ⚠️ TRAP/WARNING: Often mistaken, distracts, or context risk—check meta annotation!  
- (Meta notes in italics.)

_This index is maintained for both human and AI navigation. When in doubt, check with AI or revisit this file for orientation._

## Root

- **AI-prompt: Principles (HOW, Efficacity)** 🟢  
    _Living record of project principles—**crucial for maintaining alignment, transparency, and AI/human self-reflexivity.**  
    Use to calibrate AI and yourself to core values and workflow philosophy before diving into technical docs._
- **My Computer Specifications** 🟡  
    _Reference hardware/environment info—can clarify why some configs/docs don’t “fit.” Only relevant for troubleshooting, sharing context with AI, or debugging environment-specific issues._
- **README** 🟢
    _General orientation. **If well-populated, read first for project overview.** If empty or minimal, skip and rely on this index._
- **temporal_narrative.md** 🟡  
    _Auxiliary project meta-narrative and orientation tool. Use for reflecting on project evolution, especially when time/context is ambiguous._
- **transcending_traps_of_the_project.md** 🟢  
    _Meta-compass for surfacing, reflecting on, and transcending both technical and meta/cognitive traps. Consult for process guidance, not as rigid law._
- **understanding_the_documentation_for_this_project.md** 🟢  
    _Project-centric synthesis distilling the paradigms, teachings, and practical affordances of major documentation sources. **Not a substitute for the docs—use as a compass for holistic orientation and meta-awareness.**_

## NIX OS/
_Meta: Centralized Nix/NixOS learning and reference.  
**Begin here for high-level system understanding—but beware: many sections are deep or reference-heavy, so use this index to sort what’s relevant to your current stage/needs.**_

### NixPills/ 🟢 **CORE**
_Deep tutorial—best resource for moving from “basic user” to “competent Nix architect.”  
Recommended for building the *mental models* needed for minimal, adaptive, declarative systems. Beware of technical depth—pace yourself, and don’t get bogged down if not every chapter is relevant yet!_
- **00-preface.md** – *(Sets intent and learning strategy. Good orientation, read if unsure where to start.)*
- **01-why-you-should-give-it-a-try.md** – *(Motivation, “what Nix is good for”—helpful if you’re still skeptical or need to align purpose.)*
- **02-install-on-your-running-system.md** – 🟠  
    _*Practical, but may be dated or not fit your minimal/context-unique setup—always double-check before running commands.*_
- **03-enter-environment.md** – 🟢  
    _*Crucial for sandboxing/isolating workflows—the core of safe, portable, reproducible hacking.*_
- **04-basics-of-language.md** – 🟢  
    _*Learn Nix language syntax and semantics—read if writing or editing any Nix expression, or debugging mysterious config failures.*_
- **05-functions-and-imports.md** – 🟢  
    _*Understand modularity/reusability in Nix. Required for meta-programmable configs.*_
- **06-20-*.md** –  
    _*Each covers an important build, package, or system management topic.  
    Pick what matches your current challenge—don’t try to “read it all” at once.*_
- **SUMMARY.md** –  
    _Navigation aid. Use to jump to topics or as a sanity check for coverage._

### NixOS Manual/ 🟢 **CORE**
_Official (and semi-official) NixOS manual—**your primary resource for nearly all system-level tasks, troubleshooting, and best practices.**  
If lost or stuck with NixOS, start here or search this first._
- **manual.md** – 🟢  
    _*Central reference—always check here for system questions before deep-diving web or forums.*_
- **Cheatsheet - NixOS Wiki.md** – 🟡  
    _*Quick, sometimes out-of-date but good for fast reference—don’t rely exclusively if details matter.*_
- **Unofficial nixos cheatsheet.md** – 🟡  
    _*Alternative cheatsheet—use for a different “voice” or where official docs are unclear.*_
- **contributing-to-this-manual.chapter.md** – 🟠  
    _*Mainly for those wanting to contribute to docs, not for core learning.*_
- **nixos-options.md** – 🟢  
    _*Reference for system configuration options—scan when tuning/tweaking system setup.*_
- **preface.md** –  
    _Meta-orientation, may clarify manual’s purpose or audience._
- **README.md, default.nix, shell.nix, common.nix** – 🟠  
    _Mostly internal or technical scaffolding; rarely needed unless hacking the manual itself or contributing upstream._

### Nix.dev/ 🟡 **PERIPHERAL**
_Official “meta site” for Nix learning.  
**Useful for initial orientation and links out to deeper resources.**  
Often, you’ll be bounced to external docs—use for broad orientation, not deep dives._
- **index.md** –  
    _Table of contents or top-level entry point._
- **install-nix.md** – 🟢  
    _*Current official instructions for installing Nix—use this over random blog posts or outdated forum advice.*_
- **recommended-reading.md** – 🟡  
    _*Good overview for “where to start” if totally new or overwhelmed by doc sprawl.*_
- **conf.py, robots.txt** – 🟠  
    _Technical/config files—ignore unless working on doc site infrastructure._

### NixOS and Flakes (book)/ 🟡  
_An evolving, book-length guide to using NixOS and Flakes.  
More in-depth than most docs, but potentially overwhelming or opinionated—use for advanced learning, not as first steps._
- **index.md, preface.md** –  
    _Start here for a sense of what’s in scope._
- **(all chapters)** –  
    _Pick by topic of current challenge. Flakes are an “advanced” Nix feature; skip unless aiming for bleeding-edge workflow or reproducibility._

### NixPkgs/ 🟡 **PERIPHERAL**
_Reference for the Nix package collection.  
Essential if you plan to write or heavily modify packages, less critical for just configuring your system.  
**Some sections are deep internals—beware rabbit holes!**_
- **functions.md, stdenv.md** – 🟠 ⚠️  
    _Read only if writing/maintaining packages. Deep, not required for normal system config—easy to lose context here._
- **manual.md.in, build-helpers.md, development.md, contributing.md, ...** – 🟡  
    _Scan as needed, but keep project needs in mind; these are more for package contributors._
- **README.md, shell.nix, lib.md** –  
    _Mostly for those hacking or extending Nixpkgs itself._

### nixacademy cheatsheet (unofficial).pdf – 🟡  
_Fast, practical reference—good for command lookup, but beware of drift/outdated advice. Double-check with official docs for critical tasks._
