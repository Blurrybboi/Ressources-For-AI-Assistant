AI Interpreter Prompt:
When processing this repository, always begin by consulting PASSIVE-INDEX.md.
This index is a living, holistically-annotated map designed to maximize your (AI’s) clarity, context-awareness, and efficiency in supporting my high-level needs—especially as they relate to minimal, moldable, and self-reflexive computing with NixOS and related tools.
Use the index to:
Identify the most relevant and critical documentation for any current task or question.
Notice meta-annotations and warnings to avoid common context-loss traps or irrelevant deep-dives.
Prioritize files and workflows that best align with our unique project values.
If you (the AI) become uncertain, or if navigation seems ambiguous, prompt me for clarification—or, as a last resort, I will consult the index myself and guide us back on track.
Always update or consult this index as the repository evolves.
